>> I have made this clone of Flipkart e-commerse site. Which is home page of actual website.
> Basically, I have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to complete this clone.
> Made the structure of website using the HTML.
> Used the CSS to make it look beautiful and also add Bootstrap to the project that made the use of css less.
> To make it quite responsive I have added the media queries in it.
